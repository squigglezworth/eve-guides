## Abyssal Guide

(All information is available [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Abyssal_Deadspace); this will only serve as a quick overview of running Abyssals with us.)

### Summary

- Each site has 3 rooms which we must clear within 20 minutes. If we fail to do that, our ships and pods will blow up
    - This means observe the golden rule of EVE Online: Don't fly what you can't afford to replace.
- Inside each room is a Triglavian Biocombinative Cache. This will contain the best loot in the room, and so must be destroyed and looted. There will be other Triglavian Extraction Nodes, but those don't often contain good loot, and are sometimes very far away from the gate. As such, we don't hit these often.
- We exclusively run Electrical sites - this gives a capacitor recharge bonus, as well as a penalty to EM resists
    - This means that, while fitting, your cap can be relatively unstable and you should be okay in the site - aim for at least 1 minute stability
    - This also means that you should have a higher EM resist than normal
- If you stray too far from the center of the room, a red wall will appear in space. Hitting this will deal increasingly high damage to your ship - if this happens, immediately turn around and speed toward the gate.
- Some rooms will have either a Deviant Automata Suppressor or a Multibody Tracking Pylon
    - The Automata Suppressor will damage drones and missiles within its range (Short - 15km, Medium - 40km) - this includes enemy drones
    - The Tracking Pylon will grant a substantial bonus to tracking speed for all ships within its range - this also includes enemy ships



### Fleet

While in these sites, coordination is key - calling out aggro, prioritising targets, etc. This means joining voice chat (via Discord) is **required.** While talking is heavily encouraged, it is not required - but you must be able to hear the FC (fleet commander)

It is also important to **pay attention** to the battlefield. Make sure you're not flying toward the wall. Make sure you're not standing still. Make sure you're focusing fire on the appropriate target

### Tags

Tags provide an easy way for FCs to mark a target with a quick reference. When enemies are tagged, prioritize the lowest numbers first. 

Tags will be used heavily, so we ask that you ensure the Tags column is easily viewable on your overview (see Overview section below)

### Target Priorities

The general rule of thumb in these sites is to kill the smaller ships first (frigates) and move up to the larger ships (destroyers, cruisers, battlecruisers.) However, some sites will have rats that we need to kill first - energy neutralizers, jammers, etc. When these show up, the FC will call out and tag the appropriate rat to shoot. 

### Logistics

When running with a logistics pilot, as we often do, it is important to stay within range of their reps - this is generally in the 40km range, but your logistics pilot should let you know exactly what it is.

Keep in mind that the closer you are to them, the more they can repair - so if things start going very south, head toward them. 

### Overview

We have a standardized overview profile that you can use if you want. Just ask and we will link it.

It's highly recommend you use this, as it has every item of interest nicely organized. If, however, you don't want to, the only thing we ask (as mentioned above) is that you add the Tags column to your overview

If you do want to use the overview we've built, we recommend you save your own overview first, so you can reload it when we're done.

You can either save your overview to a file on your computer, or save it as a link in a note, in a chat window, or whatever you want.

To export your current overview profile:

- Open the overview dropdown menu by clicking the 4 bars in the top-left of the overview window, and opening the overview settings
- From here, you can click and drag the 'Share' button from the top-right of the overview settings window into a chat, or a note (Neocom > Utilities > Notepad)
- If you want to save your overview to a file, go to the Misc tab, and click Export Overview Settings. From there, simply enter a filename, and voila! EVE will save the file and tell you where to look.
    - Reimporting this file is easy: simply go back to the Misc tab in overview settings, and click Import Overview Settings. EVE will automatically look for overview profiles in the folder it saved them (By default on Windows: `C:\Users\<User>\Documents\EVE\Overview\`)
